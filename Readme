# Hexadem

This is a web-application that can be used to encode and decode the data.

## Installation

To install it you need to have ruby and rails. 

I use rvm for various ruby versions and gems. Here are the steps to install it:

rvm use 2.5.0
bundle install --without production
bundle update
bundle install

If you use rbenv, the first command will be different, but the last three commands probably will be the same.

To run it launch rails server:

rails server

Then open 0.0.0.0:3000 in the browser.
